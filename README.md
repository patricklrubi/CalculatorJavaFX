# Calculator Using Java, JavaFX, and SceneBuilder

# Overview
This application uses Java, JavaFX, and SceneBuilder to create a calculator that can perform one mathematical operation on two numbers. The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator also supports a clear function, which resets the calculator. In addition to a clear function, this application supports the use of decimal numbers and the ability to perform operations on numbers that contains decimals. 

# Technologies Used
I used JavaFX to design the layout and appearance of the calculator application. In complement with JavaFX, I used SceneBuilder to aid in the design and funtionality of the calculator application. For the Java functionality of the calculator, I used the Eclipse IDE.

# Challenges
Initially, I struggled with the implementation of a clear feature. I was able to implement a clear funtion by treating the clear button on the calculator as an operator and adding the logic needed to have the clear funcitonality into the java function that is responsilbe for processing operators. The support of decimal numbers was also a little finicky but using Double variables allowed for the use of decimal numbers. 

# Future Features
The first thing that I am planning on implementing for this calculator app is the support for more than two terms in an expression. As the application is presently, only two terms are supported for any one mathematical operation. Expanding the capabilities to being able to support more than two terms and solve expressions following order of operations would greatly increase the practicality of this application. I also would like to implement keyboard support. Presently, the calculator's buttons only respond to being clicked, and expanding that to be able to accept keyboard inputs would also increase the funcitonality of the application.
